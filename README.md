### Why

This project was created to mimic the mySQL Preference pane that you get from downloading the mySQL tarball. It was originally created to help the interns and creative team in getting their Ruby on Rails system set up with Postgres for doing the CSS and HTML of Rails apps, and are not too familiar with the Terminal app and unix commands.
